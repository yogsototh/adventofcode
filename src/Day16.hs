--- Day 16: Permutation Promenade ---

You come upon a very unusual sight; a group of programs here appear to be
dancing.

There are sixteen programs in total, named a through p. They start by standing
in a line: a stands in position 0, b stands in position 1, and so on until p,
which stands in position 15.

The programs' dance consists of a sequence of dance moves:

- Spin, written sX, makes X programs move from the end to the front, but
  maintain their order otherwise. (For example, s3 on abcde produces cdeab).
- Exchange, written xA/B, makes the programs at positions A and B swap places.
- Partner, written pA/B, makes the programs named A and B swap places.

For example, with only five programs standing in a line (abcde), they could do
the following dance:

- s1, a spin of size 1: eabcd.
- x3/4, swapping the last two programs: eabdc.
- pe/b, swapping programs e and b: baedc.
- After finishing their dance, the programs end up in order baedc.

You watch the dance for a while and record their dance moves (your puzzle
input). In what order are the programs standing after their dance?

--- Part Two ---

Now that you're starting to get a feel for the dance moves, you turn your
attention to the dance as a whole.

Keeping the positions they ended up in from their previous dance, the programs
perform it again and again: including the first dance, a total of one billion
(1000000000) times.

In the example above, their second dance would begin with the order baedc, and
use the same dance moves:

s1, a spin of size 1: cbaed.
x3/4, swapping the last two programs: cbade.
pe/b, swapping programs e and b: ceadb.

In what order are the programs standing after their billion dances?
